Question 2.3 
Cells 19:

* In the same fashion as the previous question, the two first figures show the ECDF of number of play counts per Artist ID. The x-axis is the play counts and the y-axis represents the proportion of artists with a lower total play count than indicated by the curve. Note that the we begin here to study the data without taking into account different IDs pointing at the same artist. 
* The figures seem here to indicate that the different plays are spread out among IDs. Indeed, half of all artists have less than 900 plays.
* Some outliers can again be found among artists.
